## Executive Overview

This project presents an advanced Power BI dashboard analyzing COVID-19 district-level data.  

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of confirmed cases, recoveries, fatalities, active cases, and case fatality rate across districts.

The objective is to demonstrate real-world public health data analysis using business intelligence tools.

---

## Key Performance Indicators

- Total Confirmed Cases  
- Total Recovered  
- Total Deaths  
- Active Cases  
- Case Fatality Rate (%)  

---

## Dashboard Capabilities

- District-wise death comparison  
- Geospatial case distribution (Map visualization)  
- Recovery vs Confirmed case analysis  
- Active case trend visualization  
- KPI-based summary metrics  
- Interactive filtering and drill-down  

---

## Analytical Insights

- High recovery ratio compared to fatality rate  
- Majority of deaths concentrated in specific districts  
- Active cases significantly lower than total recovered  
- Case fatality rate maintained under controlled range
